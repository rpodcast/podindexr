`podindexr` is an R package providing a tidy interface to the [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org) database API available at <https://podcastindex-org.github.io/docs-api>. 

> The Podcast Index is here to preserve, protect and extend the open, independent podcasting ecosystem. We do this by enabling developers to have access to an open, categorized index that will always be available for free, for any use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of podindexr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rpodcast/podindexr")
```

## Configuration

The majority of the API endpoints supported by `podindexr` require an API key and secret pair. To obtain your own set, create a free developer account at <https://api.podcastindex.org> and save the credentials as environment variables called `PODCASTINDEX_API_KEY` and `PODCASTINDEX_API_SECRET` within a project-level or default user-directory `.Renviron` file. 

## Usage
